# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Netflix GPT
- Create vite app
- configured tailwind css
- Header
- routing
- login form
- sigin form
- form validation
- useRef Hook
- created user and making store in redux and display the user and giving all the display name
  
# Notes 
- routing is only done in the inside the parent routing set up tha's it 
-  once in sign up and user is created then it updates user profile by using userUpdate profile API okies we have to be update just after create the user 
-  at that time we have no user that's why it gives me error okies but we have to update the store after update the profile okies
-  now we have to use tmdb api for fetching the Movie data
-  whenever we use string always use constants dont' use hardcoded thigns in our app
